## Overview

This repository demonstrates a structured and reproducible pipeline for clinical data processing in neurosurgical and movement disorder research.

The objective is to transform raw clinical cohort data into:

- Clean, validated datasets  
- Derived clinical endpoints  
- Automated statistical analyses  
- Publication-ready visualizations  

The workflow reflects real-world clinical research requirements, including outlier detection, normality assessment, model building, and figure export at publication resolution.
